At the cell surface, the band profile of wild-type P2X2 was somewhat altered; it appeared that a greater proportion of uppermost band was present in this sample. The mutant K308A was efficiently expressed at the cell surface, but displayed a complete absence of upper band, demonstrating that the presence of the upper band was not a requirement for cell-surface expression. Interestingly, the proportion of upper band present in the mutant K308C was much greater at the cell surface than in the total protein sample, suggesting that the high-molecular-mass form of this mutant was more efficiently expressed at the cell surface than the lower molecular mass forms. The cell-surface expression of K308R was identical with wild-type (results not shown).</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>12830</offset><annotation id="18616429_3"><infon key="gene">P2rx2(114115)</infon><infon key="go-term">cell surface|GO:0009986</infon><infon key="goevidence">IDA</infon><infon key="type">GOA</infon><location offset="13168" length="413"/><text>(C) Western blot of biotinylated cell-surface protein from HEK-293 cells expressing wild-type (WT), K308A or K308C mutant P2X2 receptor. The upper band is absent in K308A, but enriched compared with total protein in K308C. (D) Summary of the cell-surface biotinylation data from 3-14 independent experiments.
