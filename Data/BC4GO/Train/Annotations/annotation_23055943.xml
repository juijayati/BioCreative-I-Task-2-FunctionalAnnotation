This segregation ratio indicates that the reactivated P1-rr' state is not heritable and reverts back to silenced state after segregation of Ufo1-1.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16998</offset><annotation id="23055943_9"><infon key="gene">Ufo1-1(3760032)</infon><infon key="go-term">DNA methylation on cytosine|GO:0032776</infon><infon key="goevidence">IDA</infon><infon key="type">GOA</infon><location offset="17806" length="393"/><text>Analysis of reactivated P1-rr'Ufo1-1 plants revealed that DNA methylation was dramatically reduced at all symmetric and asymmetric cytosines to a level comparable with that of the P1-rr ufo1 plants. Therefore, the DNA gel blot and bisulfite sequencing analyses demonstrated that Ufo1-1-mediated reactivation of P1-rr' correlates with reduction of methylation within the P1.2 enhancer fragment.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22051</offset><annotation id="23055943_10"><infon key="gene">Ufo1-1(3760032)</infon><infon key="go-term">regulation of gene expression, epigenetic|GO:0040029</infon><infon key="goevidence">IMP</infon><infon key="type">GOA</infon><location offset="23160" length="353"/><text>There were 28.2% of silk scarred and 17% of red/variegated pericarp and cob glume individuals indicating that, similar to P1-rr', P1-prTP up regulation was not heritable in the absence of Ufo1-1.
