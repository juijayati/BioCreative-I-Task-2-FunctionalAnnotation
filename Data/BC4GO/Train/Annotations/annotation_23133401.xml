We also analyzed the FIL::GFP reporter in 35S::BP gynoecia and observed a drastic reduction in GFP signal when compared to those of wild-type plants (Figure 4K and Figure S3C, S3F, S3I). Unlike the result of the in situ hybridization, in which no FIL expression was detected in 35S::BP ovaries, the reporter provided a slight but perceptible signal, possibly because of a higher sensitivity in the detection of GFP. All together these data strongly suggest that ectopically expressed BP, directly or indirectly, downregulates JAG/FIL activity genes in ovaries. </text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20827</offset><annotation id="23133401_20"><infon key="gene">BP(826364)</infon><infon key="go-term">fruit development|GO:0010154</infon><infon key="goevidence">IMP</infon><infon key="type">GOA</infon><location offset="20827" length="538"/><text>To further investigate how ectopic BP expression affects the fruit, we made use of transgenic FIL&gt;&gt;BP plants, in which the BP coding region is transcribed in the FIL expression domain.

In the basal region of as1 fil yab3 ovaries, the most prevalent phenotype was the presence of two thin stripes of valve margin located at the lateral-most regions of the ovary, both separating what we called two giant &quot;super-repla&quot; (Figure 6H, 6L). We also found fruits with extremely small valves separated from the oversized repla by valve margin tissue (Figure S10B). The aberrant replum of as1 fil yab3 fruits contained wide and large cells and fully developed stomata, making this tissue to adopt a similar appearance to wild-type valves (Figure S7F). In fact, the phenotype was even stronger in the apical region of the ovary where only these wide and large cells and stomata could be observed, completely lacking valve margin tissue (Figure 6H, 6K).</text></annotation><annotation id="23133401_35"><infon key="gene">AS1(818340)</infon><infon key="go-term">fruit development|GO:0010154</infon><infon key="goevidence">IGI</infon><infon key="type">GOA</infon><location offset="34640" length="266"/><text>These abnormalities make as1 fil yab3 fruits quite different from those of jag fil yab3 triple mutants, since the former are mainly composed of giant replum, while the latter clearly show valve and replum regions, as the signal for the BP::GUS revealed (Figure S11).</text></annotation><annotation id="23133401_36"><infon key="gene">FIL(819127)</infon><infon key="go-term">fruit development|GO:0010154</infon><infon key="goevidence">IGI</infon><infon key="type">GOA</infon><location offset="34640" length="266"/><text>These abnormalities make as1 fil yab3 fruits quite different from those of jag fil yab3 triple mutants, since the former are mainly composed of giant replum, while the latter clearly show valve and replum regions, as the signal for the BP::GUS revealed (Figure S11).</text></annotation><annotation id="23133401_37"><infon key="gene">YAB3(827914)</infon><infon key="go-term">fruit development|GO:0010154</infon><infon key="goevidence">IGI</infon><infon key="type">GOA</infon><location offset="34640" length="266"/><text>These abnormalities make as1 fil yab3 fruits quite different from those of jag fil yab3 triple mutants, since the former are mainly composed of giant replum, while the latter clearly show valve and replum regions, as the signal for the BP::GUS revealed (Figure S11).</text></annotation><annotation id="23133401_38"><infon key="gene">BP(826364)</infon><infon key="go-term">fruit development|GO:0010154</infon><infon key="goevidence">IGI</infon><infon key="type">GOA</infon><location offset="34907" length="211"/><text>In 35S::BP fil yab3 plants, the fruit mutant phenotype was even stronger, and both apical and basal regions of the ovary showed the same aspect as the apical region of ovaries in as1 fil yab3 fruits (Figure 6I).</text></annotation><annotation id="23133401_39"><infon key="gene">FIL(819127)</infon><infon key="go-term">fruit development|GO:0010154</infon><infon key="goevidence">IGI</infon><infon key="type">GOA</infon><location offset="34907" length="211"/><text>In 35S::BP fil yab3 plants, the fruit mutant phenotype was even stronger, and both apical and basal regions of the ovary showed the same aspect as the apical region of ovaries in as1 fil yab3 fruits (Figure 6I).</text></annotation><annotation id="23133401_40"><infon key="gene">YAB3(827914)</infon><infon key="go-term">fruit development|GO:0010154</infon><infon key="goevidence">IGI</infon><infon key="type">GOA</infon><location offset="34907" length="211"/><text>In 35S::BP fil yab3 plants, the fruit mutant phenotype was even stronger, and both apical and basal regions of the ovary showed the same aspect as the apical region of ovaries in as1 fil yab3 fruits (Figure 6I).</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35119</offset><annotation id="23133401_41"><infon key="gene">AS1(818340)</infon><infon key="go-term">fruit development|GO:0010154</infon><infon key="goevidence">IGI</infon><infon key="type">GOA</infon><location offset="35391" length="507"/><text>The fruit phenotypes described for combinations of as1 and mutant alleles in JAG/FIL activity genes are very much in line with these predictions (Figure 7G and Figure S6).
