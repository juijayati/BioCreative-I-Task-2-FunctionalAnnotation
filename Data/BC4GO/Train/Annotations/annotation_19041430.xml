The equilibrium binding constants (Kapp) obtained by fitting the experimental points to the Hill equation (Eq. 1) are summarized in Table 1 and show that actin truncation reduced the isoforms' affinity by a factor ranging between 1.2 and 1.5. The cooperativity coefficient (alphaH) of TMs binding to F-actin-3 was slightly greater than that for the binding to F-actin. The only TM isoform which bound to F-actin-3 with lower cooperativity was TM2 (Table 1).</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13591</offset><annotation id="19041430_4"><infon key="gene">Tpm1(24851)</infon><infon key="go-term">actin binding|GO:0003779</infon><infon key="goevidence">IDA</infon><infon key="type">GOA</infon><location offset="13928" length="373"/><text>The analysis revealed that in the case of three isoforms (smTM, TM1b9a and TM5a) the affinity to an isolated binding site (Ko) was reduced and binding to a contiguous site (omega) was increased by modification of the actin C-terminus. The TM2 bound to truncated actin with a binding coefficient Ko similar to that of native actin and with the lower cooperativity (Table 1).</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15583</offset><annotation id="19041430_5"><infon key="gene">Tpm1(24851)</infon><infon key="go-term">actin binding|GO:0003779</infon><infon key="goevidence">IDA</infon><infon key="type">GOA</infon><location offset="15692" length="228"/><text>While long isoforms (smTM and TM2) were not sensitive to actin truncation and bound to both types of actin with the same cooperativity, the short TMs, TM1b9a and TM5a, bound more easily to modified than to native actin (Fig. 4).</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17557</offset><annotation id="19041430_6"><infon key="gene">Tpm1(24851)</infon><infon key="go-term">regulation of ATPase activity|GO:0043462</infon><infon key="goevidence">IDA</infon><infon key="type">GOA</infon><location offset="18458" length="244"/><text>The TM5a activated the ATPase, which agrees with a previous report showing that this isoform is very efficient in the activation of thin filament [37].
