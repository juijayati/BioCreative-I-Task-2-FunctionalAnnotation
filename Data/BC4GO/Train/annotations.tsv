The mutant K308A was efficiently expressed at the cell surface, but displayed a complete absence of upper band, demonstrating that the presence of the upper band was not a requirement for cell-surface expression. Interestingly, the proportion of upper band present in the mutant K308C was much greater at the cell surface than in the total protein sample, suggesting that the high-molecular-mass form of this mutant was more efficiently expressed at the cell surface than the lower molecular mass forms.

Although control GFP overexpression had no effect on Plk4-GFP levels, Tws-GFP overexpression dramatically increased Plk4-GFP levels in asynchronous cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4, A and B).

This resulted in a marked increase in MyoV staining (compare Fig. 2 A with Fig. 2 D). Quantification of MyoV fluorescence (normalized to WT MyoV fluorescence per ommatidium, as described in Materials and methods) showed that the reduction of MyoV seen in crb mutant photoreceptors is rescued to ~80% of that seen in WT ommatidia upon proteasome inhibition in comparison with ~50% in the absence of proteasomal inhibition (Fig. 2 E).

Despite the extremely simplified nature of the S2R+ system in comparison with PRCs and the fact that in crb mutant photoreceptors, the residual MyoV localization is predominantly WT, we tested whether or not Crb is capable of performing the same function in PRCs. Using Rh1-Gal4, we expressed either full-length Crb (CrbFull length) or a construct of Crb in which the extracellular domain of Crb has been replaced by a Flag tag (CrbFlag intra). Although both of these transgene-encoded proteins localize ectopically to the rhabdomere base and basolateral membranes, as previously described (Richard et al., 2009), neither is able to recruit MyoV to these sites (Fig. 5, E and F). Therefore, we conclude that the S2R+ experiments can be used only as a basic method to analyze the domains for the Crb-MyoV interaction and that the physiologically relevant role of this interaction in the adult photoreceptor is not one of recruitment/localization but rather of stabilization.	42896	GO:0050821

22291037	paragraph	16348	22291037_19	Arl1	protein targeting to Golgi	IDA	GOA	16461	688	It has been reported that the N-terminal 561 residues of human BIG1 are sufficient for Golgi targeting in mammalian cells (Mansour et al., 1999). When the equivalent region of Sec71 was expressed in S2 cells, it showed only weak Golgi staining (Fig. 4 B). However, when it was coexpressed with Drosophila Arl1, this N-terminal region was efficiently recruited to the Golgi (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, the region of Sec71 C terminal to the Sec7 domain was diffusely distributed in the cytosol, irrespective of Arl1 overexpression. This indicates that Arl1 recruits Sec71 to Golgi membranes, but it appears that Arl1's effects are augmented by additional interactions elsewhere in the protein.	39745	GO:0000042

The cuticle phenotype was equally prevalent in males and females (Figure 4A). These RNAi results corroborate those reported for the Cyp301a1f02301 insertion strain, suggesting that a loss of Cyp301a1 is likely to be responsible for the cuticle malformation.	36378	GO:0008365

Necrosis of the front leg joints was also observed in some of these flies (Fig. S2-B).

We also analyzed the FIL::GFP reporter in 35S::BP gynoecia and observed a drastic reduction in GFP signal when compared to those of wild-type plants (Figure 4K and Figure S3C, S3F, S3I). Unlike the result of the in situ hybridization, in which no FIL expression was detected in 35S::BP ovaries, the reporter provided a slight but perceptible signal, possibly because of a higher sensitivity in the detection of GFP. All together these data strongly suggest that ectopically expressed BP, directly or indirectly, downregulates JAG/FIL activity genes in ovaries. 	826364	GO:0010629
